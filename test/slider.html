            <h2>History and the Three Museums</h2>
            <p>The Harvard Art Museums are comprised of three separate museums—the Fogg Museum,
                Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M. Sackler Museum—each with a different history,
                collection, guiding philosophy, and identity.</p><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fogg Museum</h3>
            <p>The Fogg Museum opened in 1895 on the northern edge of Harvard Yard in a modest Beaux-Arts
                building designed by Richard Morris Hunt, twenty-one years after the President and Fellows
                of Harvard College appointed Charles Eliot Norton the first professor of art history in
                America. It was made possible when, in 1891, Mrs. Elizabeth Fogg gave a gift in memory of
                her husband to build “an Art Museum to be called and known as the William Hayes Fogg Museum
                of Harvard College.” In 1927, the Fogg Museum moved to its home at 32 Quincy Street. <br />
                Designed by architects Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch, and Abbott of Boston, the joint art
                museum and teaching facility was the first purpose-built structure for the specialized
                training of art scholars, conservators, and museum professionals in North America. With an
                early collection that consisted largely of plaster casts and photographs, the Fogg Museum is
                now renowned for its holdings of Western paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, photographs,
                prints, and drawings dating from the Middle Ages to the present.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Busch-Reisinger Museum</h3>
            <p>The Busch-Reisinger Museum was founded in 1901 as the Germanic Museum. Unique among North
                American museums, the Busch-Reisinger is dedicated to the study of all modes and periods of
                art from central and northern Europe, with an emphasis on German-speaking countries. In 1921
                the Germanic Museum moved to Adolphus Busch Hall, built partly with funds from Adolphus
                Busch’s son-in-law, Hugo Reisinger, and in 1950 it was renamed the Busch-Reisinger Museum.
                The museum moved again in 1991, this time to Werner Otto Hall at 32 Quincy Street, designed
                by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates. Adolphus Busch Hall continues to house the founding
                collection of plaster casts of medieval art and is the venue for concerts on its
                world-renowned Flentrop pipe organ, while the Busch-Reisinger Museum’s holdings include
                significant works of Austrian Secession art, German expressionism, 1920s abstraction, and
                materials related to the Bauhaus. Other strengths include late-medieval sculpture and
                eighteenth-century art. The museum also holds noteworthy postwar and contemporary art from
                German-speaking Europe.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Arthur M. Sackler Museum</h3>
            <p>In 1912, Langdon Warner taught the first courses in Asian art at Harvard, and the first at
                any American university. By 1977, Harvard’s collections of Asian, ancient, and Islamic and
                later Indian art had grown sufficiently in size and importance to require a larger space for
                their display and study. With the generosity of Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, a leading
                psychiatrist, entrepreneur, art collector, and philanthropist, the Harvard Art Museums
                founded a museum dedicated to works from Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. The
                Arthur M. Sackler Museum, a new museum building at 485 Broadway designed by James Stirling,
                opened in 1985. This structure remains the home of the History of Art and Architecture
                Department and the Media Slide Library.</p><br><br>

            <h3>Renovation and Expansion</h3>
            <p>The Harvard Art Museums’ recent renovation and expansion builds on the legacies of these
                three museums and unites their remarkable collections under one roof for the first time.
                Renzo Piano Building Workshop’s responsive design preserved the Fogg Museum’s landmark 1927
                facility, while transforming the space to accommodate twenty-first-century needs. <br><br />
                Following a six-year building project, the museums now feature 40 percent more gallery
                space, an expanded Art Study Center, conservation labs, and classrooms, and a striking new
                glass roof that bridges the facility’s historic and contemporary architecture. <br><br />
                In line with Harvard’s commitment to sustainability, the museums’ renovation and expansion
                achieved LEED Gold certification for incorporating a wide range of green building
                technologies including, energy efficient LED bulbs and an innovative water conservation
                system. The new Harvard Art Museums’ building is more functional, accessible, spacious, and
                above all, more transparent. The three constituent museums retain their distinct identities
                in this new facility, yet their close proximity provides exciting opportunities to
                experience works of art in a broader context.</p>
